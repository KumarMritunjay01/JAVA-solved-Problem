 Q2 - Given two arrays a[] and b[] of size n and m respectively where m >= n. The task is to find 
 union between these two arrays and print the number of elements of the union set.
 Union of the two arrays can be defined as the set containing distinct elements from both 
 the arrays. If there are repetitions, then only one occurrence of element should be printed 
 in the union

 Q4 - Given an unsorted array A of size N that contains only non-negative integers, find a 
 continuous sub-array which adds to a given number S.
 In case of multiple subarrays, return the subarray which comes first on moving from left
